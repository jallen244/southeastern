      <h1>Disability Benefits Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p class="faq-description">The Social Security Administration pays benefits under several different programs. The largest and most important program is the SSDI or Social Security disability program. The other program is the SSI program which in addition to medical requirements has an income and resource component in determining eligibility.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">Expediting the Social Security Disability Application Process</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>In certain circumstances your claim for benefits can be expedited. One reason may be if you have a terminal illness. If you have a terminal illness, notify our office immediately and we will help you get the documentation necessary to turn in to SSA.
            Another circumstance that may speed up your case is if you are in a dire need situation. Some examples of a dire need situation would be home foreclosure, bankruptcy, etc.
            Social Security also has a class of conditions called “Compassionate Allowances” the list of qualifying conditions can be found at https://www.ssa.gov/compassionateallowances/conditions.html</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How do I determine when my disability begins?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>There are many variables that can factor into determining the proper “onset” date in a disability case. If you’ve worked five out of the last ten years, we can meet with you and help you determine the most advantageous date to maximize your past-due benefits and document any issues necessary to support the date we choose. This is important because SSA can potentially pay you up to 12 months of benefits prior to your application date. That’s why we suggest consulting us before filing your claim and let us determine the best “onset” date for you and not leaving it up to SSA to “pick a date” for you.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Will I need to get a medical opinion from my doctor?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Though not required, a supportive medical opinion from your doctor can sometimes help your case. The ALJ will determine how much weight to give that opinion based on a number of factors such as: the specialty of the doctor, the length of the treating relationship, how consistent the opinion is with other evidence in your file, and other factors. At Southeastern Disability, we have a library of specialized forms that you can take to your doctor to get completed.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What if I have no income whle I am waiting for my disability?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A request for an expedited hearing or an “on-the-record” decision based upon a “dire need” situation such as an impending foreclosure or loss of shelter, diagnosis of a new terminal medical condition, or other emergency situations can be sumbitted to SSA. However, such “dire need” requests are usually rarely granted. Contact our office if you feel like your condition may qualify for special consideration.</p>
