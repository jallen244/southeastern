        <button class="faq-question">Being Honest About Work Attempts During Your Disability Hearing</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Social Security has access to your earnings record. If your employer reported wages, Social Security is likely aware. Attempting to hide work efforts can harm your credibility. However, demonstrating that you tried to work but couldn’t sustain employment due to your disability can be beneficial. Consult an expert to determine the best approach for discussing work attempts after your onset date.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">Addressing Gaps in Your Earnings History</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Judges may inquire about periods without reported earnings. Be ready to explain reasons such as incarceration, informal work, or caregiving responsibilities. Providing clear explanations for gaps in your earnings over the 5 years prior to your onset date can strengthen your case.

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Not being able to afford medical care is understandable if you have no medical insurance or income. Social Security can only decide cases based on medical evidence.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Differentiating Between Retirement and Disability</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Engaging in activities like hunting and fishing regularly may give the impression of an active retirement rather than a disabling condition. It’s important to convey how your disability limits your daily activities.

      <div class="faq-item">

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Choosing Healthcare Providers Who Maintain Thorough Records</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Clearly Communicating Your Limitations</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A disability hearing isn’t a job interview. Downplaying your symptoms can lead the judge to underestimate the severity of your condition(s). Be honest and thorough in describing how your disabilities affects your daily life.

      <div class="faq-item">

        <div class="faq-answer">

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Seeking Medical Opinions from Supportive and Qualified Providers</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A “bad” medical opinion is worse than no medical opinion. Forcing a medical provider to complete a medical opinion form is a bad idea. Often, they will complete it in such a way as to show you are not disabled at all. And, if your doctor completes a form in a negative way, you still must submit it to Social Security for consideration. This can have a catastrophic effect on your case.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Clarifying Household Responsibilities in Your Disability Claim</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Judges may question household dynamics if both spouses are disabled. Clearly explaining how household tasks are managed can prevent misunderstandings about your functional abilities.

        <button class="faq-question">Clarifying Household Responsibilities in Your Disability Claim</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>It usually takes 4-6 weeks after your hearing for a decision to be issued. After the hearing the Judge will review your records, testimony, and any additional evidence or arguments, and issue a decision. Once he/she issues a decision, your case will go over to a decision writing unit for processing and writing a formal decision</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Filing for benefits before your conditions become “severe”</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Applying for disability benefits prematurely, before your medical condition has reached a level of severity that significantly impairs your ability to work, can lead to claim denial. It’s crucial to wait until your condition is well-documented and meets the necessary severity criteria before filing.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Offering too much information at your disability hearing</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>While honesty is essential, volunteering excessive or unsolicited information during your disability hearing can inadvertently harm your case. Focus on directly answering the judge’s questions and providing information pertinent to your disability and its impact on your ability to work.
